### Overview

The goal of this presentation is to determine sales projections for FY 2016 liquor sales in Iowa, so the government can consider whether or not to raise taxes. My methodology included studying the FY 2015 sales and creating a linear regression model to predict Q2, Q3 and Q4 sales from Q1 2016 data.

My recommendation was that the government should not raise taxes, since sales are projected to increase thus creating more taxable income.

### Motivation

This is another simple Data Analysis project but this time it includes a forecasting element. 

This was the second project from my Data Science Immersive Bootcamp at General Assembly.
